# **Audio Signal Processing Artificial Intelligence Project**

I developed the Audio Signal Processing Project for an interview. The company gave this assignment as an assigment. I coded this project in about 38-40 minutes and created the dataset. I created the algorithm in about 7 minutes. The algorithm is very performant and very strong against overfitting. Therefore, the software correctly predicted all of the test data without overfitting. The algorithm that I developed has a total of 8114 neurons (total of input and output layers) and an average of 2 million parameters.

In my Audio Signal Processing Project, I gave importance to data cleaning by removing noise while processing data. In this way, the data focused only on the specified sound. In this software, I distinguish between walking and speaking sounds. The software that I made detected how a person makes a sound while walking.

Kind regards,
